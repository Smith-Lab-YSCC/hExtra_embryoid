# hExtra_embryoid

## Abstract
Investigating human development is a significant scientific challenge due to the
technical and ethical limitations of working with bona fide embryo samples. In the face
of these difficulties, stem cells have been applied to experimentally model inaccessible
stages of human development in vitro 1-11 . Here we show that human pluripotent stem
cells can be triggered to self-organise into three-dimensional structures that recapitulate
the spatiotemporal events of early human post-implantation embryonic development.
Importantly, our system reproducibly captures de novo differentiation and co-
development of embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages, establishes key signalling
hubs with secreted modulators, and undergoes gastrulation-like symmetry breaking.
Single-cell transcriptomics confirms differentiation into diverse cell states of the native
gastrulating human embryo 12 , including signatures of post-implantation epiblast,
amniotic ectoderm, primitive streak, mesoderm, and hypoblast, as well as pre-
patterning of non-neural ectoderm and yolk sac. Collectively, our system captures key
features of human embryonic development spanning from Carnegie-stage 13 (CS) 4 to
CS7, providing a reproducible, tractable, and permutable experimental platform to
understand the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie human
development, and a high-throughput platform to dissect developmental disorders and
congenital pathologies.

## Structure

This repository contains the code used to process and generate the single-cell RNA-sequencing data and figures presented in Pedroza et al., 2023: "Human post-implantation development in vitro by de novo embryonic and extra-embryonic lineage patterning". Analysis methods and logic underlying decisions are described within hEE_analysis_summary.

## Data Availability

The original scRNA-seq dataset for the extra-embryoid can be found in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession code GSE208195.
